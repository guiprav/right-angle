Right Angle
===

This is a test automation framework for Protractor.

I got tired of updating this README file as I explore Right Angle's API design possibilities, so I'll try again when it's more stable.

You can see it doing its thing here: [asciinema.org/a/17746](https://asciinema.org/a/17746).

Installing
---

To install Right Angle, use `npm`:

	$ npm install n2liquid/right-angle

I recommend having a `package.json` file for your project and using:

	$ npm install --save n2liquid/right-angle

instead. This will install the package and add it as a dependency to your `package.json` file.

In your Protractor configuration file, in order to activate Right Angle, you must let it configure Protractor. See [example/protractor.conf.js](example/protractor.conf.js).

To run your tests, simply invoke Protractor using your own configuration file:

	$ protractor my-protractor.conf.js

(This requires Protractor to be installed globally. Also, don't forget to run the WebDriver first with `webdriver-manager start`).

Example project
---

Right Angle comes with [an example test automation project](example/) (a partial port of [the official Protractor tutorial](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial)). To run it, you can do this:

	# Clone this repository.
	$ git clone https://github.com/n2liquid/right-angle.git

	# Change into example directory.
	$ cd right-angle/example/

	# Install dependencies.
	$ npm install

	# Run the WebDriver (If not yet running).
	# This requires Protractor to be installed globally!
	$ webdriver-manager start

	# And finally, run the tests.
	$ npm test

From looking at the files in the 'example/' directory, you can have a good idea how everything fits together.
