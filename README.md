Right Angle
===

This is a test automation framework for Protractor.

It structures test suites in terms of Pages, Features, Scenarios, and Steps.

Right Angle will automatically load all feature files from the 'feature/' directory and execute each of the defined feature test scenarios. Those scenarios are basically arrays of steps to be executed and their parameters.

Steps are automatically loaded from step bundle files in the 'step/' directory. Step bundles are nothing but a way to group related steps. Step grouping rules are up to you, but generally you'll have more generic bundles for common page operations, such as "Log in" and "Log out" in 'step/session.js', and more specific bundles maybe named after the features or scenarios they're used in.

Pages are modules implementing the Page Object pattern: They usually contain element locators and maybe other page-specific goodies.

Installing
---

To install Right Angle, use `npm`:

	$ npm install right-angle

I recommend having a `package.json` file for your project and using:

	$ npm install --save right-angle

instead. This will install the package and add it as a dependency to your `package.json` file.

In your Protractor configuration file, in order to activate Right Angle, you must let it configure Protractor. See [example/protractor.conf.js](example/protractor.conf.js).

To run your tests, simply invoke Protractor using your own configuration file:

	$ protractor my-protractor.conf.js

(This requires Protractor to be installed globally. Also, don't forget to run the WebDriver first with `webdriver-manager start`).

Example project
---

Right Angle comes with [an example test automation project](example/). To run it, you can do this:

	# Clone this repository.
	$ git clone https://github.com/n2liquid/right-angle.git

	# Change into example directory.
	$ cd right-angle/example/

	# Install dependencies.
	$ npm install

	# Run the WebDriver (If not yet running).
	$ webdriver-manager start

	# And finally, run the tests.
	$ npm test

From looking at the files in the 'example/' directory, you can have a good idea how everything fits together.
